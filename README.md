This is a Headless website developed on worpdress as backend and using react for the frontend.

package install:
For a local installation you must install this few libraries:

## npm i
## npm react react-router-dom
## npm i framer-motion
## npm i normalize

Then you can start changing things here.

** Remember **
If you do not study the code before commiting and pushing changes to the main branch, you probably fucked up.
So, be carefully, and do not try to code, before studying.
This is a project that has a lot of hours on it, so do not touch it, if you do not know react, or if you do not know what you are doing.

The folders and files are really explicit, so there is not too much comments, but if you dont understand what you see. USE CHATGPT BEFORE MAKING MISTAKES.


# Thank you for READING BEFORE CODING.
